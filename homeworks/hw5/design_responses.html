                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> This article was extremely cool to go through because of all of the different types of designs I was able to explore. I learned a lot about how good layouts look, and how intuitive design looks. I was also able to differentiate between interactions that were better than others due to color choices, visual hierarchy, or just level of ease to navigate the app. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite UI interactions were the Travel Map, the Shopping Transitions, and the Story Welcome Page. The Welcome page caught my eye due to the way the login button prompted a response that clearly showed that the user was on a different page, with clear contrasts, art, and a very cool transition.  </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>The shopping transitions served as my inspiration because I want to make technology as seamless and intuitive as possible. Every page of the transitions was extremely seamless yet clear and every option was highlighted so the user would know the exact customizations they chose for each product. It made online shopping seem like an experience instead of a task, and this is one of my goals for any deliverable I create. The colors played a huge role in the interface but the app didn't solely rely on colors and used animations to show that an option was being selected. </p>
