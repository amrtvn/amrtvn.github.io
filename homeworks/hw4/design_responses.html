						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Reading this article I learned that there are specific color accessibility guidelines set by the W3C that are the gold standard to follow, and that there is a specific ratio (4.5:1) that is required for contrast to be deemed accessible. I didn't know that there were this many factors involved such as focus states, and color systems, so it was interesting to learn what they were. I also learned about using iconography and patterns as an alternative to solely rely on color which can greatly improve the accessibility of a website.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was when the author outlined how to document and socialize a color system. They provided an example with different contrasts and their ratings form A-AAA. I also really liked the portion which discussed the iconography because it is something that I never really considered but it does make a huge difference. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Color accessibility requires a little up-front work when selecting your product’s color palette, but ensuring your colors are accessible will pay dividends down the road." AND "Also, not creating accessible products is just rude, so don’t be rude." </p>
						</li>
