							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really enjoyed reading this article mainly because it highlighted yet another important aspect of design. When I first started this decal I was very much focused on the design tools we use, and didn't take into consideration all of the factors that affect the quality of the interface. This article's focus on attention really brought to light that the interface aesthetic must take into account the purpose and possible stimuli that the user is facing to create effective design. An interesting example they gave was that we as humans have to ability to go from divided to focused attention really quickly and having auditory and visual stimuli at once is easier to switch attention to one thing, than having two visual elements. As UX designers we can use this to create an interface that sustains the user's attention or demands less of them so they can make interactive decisions easily.</p>
