					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article was dense with information about animation and I learned quite a bit from every section. I learned that speed matters greatly for animation and there are right speeds based on the devices that are used that determine the user's attention. I also learned that certain effects shouldn't be used to maintain clarity, and we should almost always use transitions like easing in to mimic reality. In essence, animation should be as adhering to the physical world as possible with acceleration, relativity, speed, and motion being respected.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was learning about easing and curves. Each animation curve contributes to expressing a certain mood/places emphasis on a certain object. By changing the curve, one can greatly affect how to object is perceived and how realistic the animation is. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> 'But do not forget that animation is more of an art than science, so itâ€™s better to experiment and test your decisions on users.'</p>
						</li>
