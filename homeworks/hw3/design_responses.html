							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I never knew that typography could be mathematical and that font sizes could be derived through a formula. It was extremely interesting to me because it brought back procedure and structure to design and made it more clear than just 'going with your gut'. I also learned about different resources like FontPair and Scratch that could aid in my typography choices.  </p>
