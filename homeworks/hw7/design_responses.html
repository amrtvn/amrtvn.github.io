						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned a lot about the different ways things are perceived as a group using the Gestalt principles. I also learned how in UI design we can use what we know about Gestalt principles and do the opposite to highlight a specific element or create a focal point. For example, symmetry is used to create groups, but including asymmetry breaks up monotony and allows for the user to follow the flow of the page. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I found reification and emergence to be the most interesting as they are currently manifested as closure. Using these concepts icons can be designed that are minimalistic yet convey the message needed.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> 'There are different ways of making elements perceived as being similar, and thus, related. These include similarity of colour, size, shape, texture, dimension, and orientation; with some of them being more strongly communicative than others (ex. colour > size > shape). ' </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
