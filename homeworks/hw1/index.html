        <em> Cognitive Science + Data Science | Sophomore </em>
        <p> Hey! I'm Amrita and I'm a South Asian American teenager from LA who loves talking, designing, eating, travelling, and crying. When I'm not doing CS or Data HW, you'll catch me thinking up events for my residents up here in Foothill, gigging to In N Out, or binging Netflix. If you see me, say hi!</p>
        <p> My Three Favorite Places to eat in Berkeley are:</p>
        <ul> 
            <li> La Val's</li>
            <li> Dumpling Kitchen </li>
            <li> Imm Thai </li>
        </ul>

            <li> Reading this article I learned about how to dissect an app's interface and design instead of just going through and using the app in question. One thing I especially didn't know was how important hierarchies are, and I feel that I will pay more attention to them in my design process.</li>
            <li> My favorite part of this article had to be the GIFs the author created to break down twitter and AirBnB's design. It was interesting to see the components, as it indicated what the design process might have been like and what iterations the apps might have gone through. </li>
            <li> "Know the rules, so you can break em."</li>
            <li> I would rate my experience reading this article an 8/10.</li>
        </ul>
